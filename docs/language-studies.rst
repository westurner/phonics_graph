Language Studies
=================


Objectives
===========
- Learn and teach language(s) to children and to adults
- Communicate clearly and effectively in written and spoken mediums

  - Note that - while there is considerable overlap - communications
    studies and composition are technically distinct fields.

- Write code to transliterate to and from :ref:`NATO phonetic alphabet`
  in particular for emergency e.g. radio use
- Learn to read word pronunciations coded as :ref:`IPA` 
  as are found in dictionaries (which are indeed being
  supplanted by apps like e.g. Google Translate)
- Generate flash cards
- Catalog references useful for context and further study
  of and in English and other languages

Great Vowel Shift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift

Between 1400 and 1700 or so, all English long vowel pronunciations
and some consonant pronunciations
changed during the Great Vowel Shift. This is the reason that English
now differs so much from its Germanic, Norse, and French (Romance;
Vulgar Latin) origins.
